# GitHub_Organization_Info
Info on my GitHub organizations and their usage. 
 
***

## About

See above. This is an article project that documents info on my usage of GitHub organizations.

***

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/wiki)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

## GitHub organization usage

This document goes over info related to my usage of GitHub organizations.

### Monthly limit

I try to limit my creation of organizations to 10 per month to keep within the amount that can be displayed in my monthly log (exception months include September 2020 and April 2021)

### Skeumorphism

I go out of my way to get images for the organizations featuring Skeumorphism or some form of gradient, as I hate flat design/material design. Most images are placeholders for now, and I don't own the rights to them.

### As a playlist or project

I use organizations as a playlist or a project of different repositories. There are multiple layers to this at times.

#### Category

Organizations are used as categories of projects.

#### Layer 1

Layer 1 projects are the main projects of the category, and are typically pinned to the top.

#### Layer 2

Layer 2 are sub-category projects and generally have to be searched for.

#### Layer 3

Layer 3 projects are forks of other projects. I do not own these most of the time, but they link directly to the creator.

### Cybersquatting

I am not cybersquatting, due to my inclusion of a brand word in the name of the organization. Some organizations, such as NimbleBit-Games are placeholder names, and will be changed upon NimbleBit/Other companies request, although the username "NimbleBit" has been taken since 2011.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
